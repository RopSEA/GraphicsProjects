# GraphicsProjects

## Assignment 1

This assignment was to use python and moderngl to create a window that would 
flash random colors in the corresponding window that was created


## Assignment 2

This assignment was to use moderngl in python to create a triangle using vertcie positions
and then thrwoing them into a vertex shader which would compute the positions then draw them on the screen
creating a triangle after moving them through the fragment shader which will color the needed verticies in white


## Assignment 3

This assignment was to use the graphical equations to plot out the points to make out a heart through creating 
vertex points for each point. Then it was to take those points and color them magenta within the fragment shader.
in the graphical loop of the program we were then to feed in a scale factor in order to make the plotted shape 
to oscilate size from big to small.


## Assignment 4

This assignment was to create a object loader that would compute the bounds and vertex data used to load the object
onto the screen from a .obj file starting witht the first object the teapot. You as the user would then be able to 
select between keyboard 1-6 in order to see the given object rotate in 3D space. All of which would be colored by
the fragment shader to be colored by the normals of the object.


## Assignment 5

Very Similar to the previous assignment, all that was changed here was the perspective of the camera which had changed 
from a regular view to a birds eye view looking down on all of the objects.


## Assignment 6
