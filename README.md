# GraphicsProjects

## Assignment 1

This assignment was to use python and moderngl to create a window that would 
flash random colors in the corresponding window that was created


## Assignment 2

This assignment was to use moderngl in python to create a triangle using vertcie positions
and then thrwoing them into a vertex shader which would compute the positions then draw them on the screen
creating a triangle after moving them through the fragment shader which will color the needed verticies in white


## Assignment 3

This assignment was to use the graphical equations to plot out the points to make out a heart through creating 
vertex points for each point. Then it was to take those points and color them magenta. in the graphical loop
of the program we were then to feed in a scale factor in order to make the plotted shape to oscilate
from big to small
